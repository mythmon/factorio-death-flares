# Death Flares

This mod adds an item you keep in your inventory. When you die with an
emergency flare in your inventory, you'll set it off with your dying breath.
The advantage of this is that you can find your body faster within the pile
of death biters you've caused before the fatal hit.

# Attribution

This mod is a fork of [CorpseFlare by
lovely_santa](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/CorpseFlare), with the added
feature that the lifetime of the flares are tied to the corpse that spawned
them. All graphics are originally from that mod, and have not been modified.

The new functionality was heavily inspired by code from the mod [Death
Markers by Kovus](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/DeathMarkers).
